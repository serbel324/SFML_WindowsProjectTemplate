# SFML_WindowsProjectTemplate

This project is the template for Visual Studio 2019. 
It is configured to work with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library and provides basic functionality for window applications.

## Installation ##

1. Download SFML from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php.
2. Extract files from the archive to C:/SFML/x86 or C:/SFML/x64 depending on your version.
3. Clone this repo.

If you want to use other installation path for SFML you have to manually configure project properties. 
Follow the instructions from the official tutorial https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php

Note: SFML is configured for static linking, so the produced .exe doesn't require SFML's .dll files, but the .exe file itself is larger.
